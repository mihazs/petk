## [2025-08-19 18:12:40] Documentation Template Syntax Hallucination Correction

- **Type:** Fixed
- **Docs:** apps/docs/docs/reference/template-syntax.md, apps/docs/docs/learning/getting-started.md, apps/docs/docs/learning/first-template.md, apps/docs/docs/problems/use-cases.md
- **Architecture:** No changes made to docs/README.md or documentation structure
- **Summary:**
  Systematic correction of widespread documentation hallucination where template syntax was incorrectly described as using HTML comments. Verified actual implementation through codebase analysis and test files, then corrected all affected documentation files to show the real markdown code block syntax.
  
  ### Fixed
   - Corrected hallucinated HTML comment syntax `<!--{ include: "file.md" }-->` to actual markdown code block syntax using `{petk:include}` with YAML parameters
   - Fixed template syntax reference documentation showing incorrect HTML comment-based examples
   - Corrected all tutorial and learning documentation with accurate syntax examples
   - Fixed problem-solving documentation use cases showing wrong directive syntax
   - Verified all corrected examples match actual test implementation in packages/engine/__tests__/

  ### Changed
   - Updated all template directive examples from HTML comments to correct markdown code blocks
   - Replaced all `<!--{ include: "path" }-->` examples with proper `{petk:include}` code block format
   - Updated variable substitution examples to confirm `{{variable}}` syntax (verified correct)
   - Enhanced documentation accuracy by basing all examples on actual codebase test patterns

  ### Verification Completed
   - Analyzed packages/engine/__tests__/parse-directive.test.ts confirming YAML directive parsing
   - Verified packages/engine/__tests__/substitute-vars.test.ts confirming {{variable}} substitution
   - Cross-referenced all documentation examples against actual test implementation
   - Confirmed template engine processes YAML content within markdown code blocks, not HTML comments

  **Critical Note:** This correction fixes a significant documentation error where the previous changelog entry (line 26) incorrectly stated HTML comment syntax was "actual" - the real syntax is markdown code blocks with `{petk:include}`, `{petk:var}`, `{petk:if}` containing YAML parameters.
