**Petk** is a command-line toolkit designed to streamline the creation and management of complex prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a powerful Markdown templating system that allows you to build prompts from smaller, reusable components.

## Core Features

  - **Modular Prompts:** Split your prompts into logical, reusable parts and compose them on the fly.
  - **Powerful Include Directive:** Use a clean, YAML-based syntax inside your Markdown to include other files.
  - **Glob & Sorting:** Include multiple files at once using glob patterns and control their order.
  - **LLM-Ready Output:** Convert your structured Markdown into a clean YAML format suitable for LLM APIs.
  - **Fast & Modern:** Built with TypeScript, Turborepo, and SWC for a high-performance, modern development experience.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add -g petk
```

## Usage

The two main commands are `build` and `convert`.

### `petk build`

This command processes a root Markdown file, resolves all `petk:include` directives, and builds a single, composite Markdown file.

**Example:**

Imagine you have the following files:

`base-prompt.md`:

````markdown
You are a helpful assistant.

```yaml
{petk:include}
files:
  - glob: "tools/*.md"
    order_by: alphabetical_asc
separator: "\n---\n"

```

Please respond to the user's query.

````

`tools/tool-a.md`:
```markdown
### Tool A
Description of Tool A.
````

`tools/tool-b.md`:

```markdown
### Tool B
Description of Tool B.
```

**Command:**

```bash
petk build base-prompt.md -o final-prompt.md
```

**Output (`final-prompt.md`):**

```markdown
You are a helpful assistant.

### Tool A
Description of Tool A.

---

### Tool B
Description of Tool B.

Please respond to the user's query.
```
