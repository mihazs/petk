# Prompt Engineering with Petk

Understanding why Petk was designed specifically for prompt engineering workflows and how it addresses the unique challenges of working with AI systems and large language models.

## The Prompt Engineering Challenge

### What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing, testing, and optimizing prompts to effectively communicate with AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs). It involves crafting precise instructions, examples, and context to achieve reliable, high-quality outputs from AI systems.

### Unique Requirements of Prompt Engineering

**Dynamic Content Assembly**
- Prompts often require combining multiple pieces of context, examples, and instructions
- Content needs to be assembled differently for different use cases or model types
- Templates must support conditional logic based on use case or target model

**Version Control and Iteration**
- Prompts evolve rapidly through testing and optimization cycles
- Need to track what works and what doesn't across different scenarios
- Require systematic approach to prompt variant testing

**Context Management**
- Modern AI systems support large context windows (32k, 128k+ tokens)
- Need efficient ways to assemble and organize large amounts of context
- Must balance comprehensive context with token efficiency

**Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**
- Prompts contain domain expertise that needs to be preserved
- Teams need to share successful patterns and approaches
- Best practices must be documented and reusable

## Why Traditional Tools Fall Short

### Limitations of Existing Solutions

**Static Documentation Tools**
- Cannot dynamically assemble content based on context
- No support for conditional logic or variable substitution
- Difficult to maintain consistency across related prompts

**Code-Based Approaches**
- Require programming knowledge for non-technical team members
- Mix business logic with prompt content
- Difficult to version and review prompt changes

**Simple Template Systems**
- Lack advanced features needed for complex prompt assembly
- No support for file inclusion or modular prompt design
- Limited ability to handle large, structured datasets

**AI-Specific Tools**
- Often locked to specific platforms or models
- Expensive enterprise solutions with unnecessary complexity
- Lack flexibility for custom workflows and integration

## Petk's Approach to Prompt Engineering

### Design Philosophy for AI Workflows

**Content-First Architecture**
Petk treats prompts as structured content rather than code, making them accessible to domain experts who understand the problem space but may not be programmers.

**Modular Composition**
Break complex prompts into reusable components that can be combined and recombined for different scenarios:

`````markdown
<!-- Base instruction template -->
```{petk:include}
path: instructions/base-reasoning.md
```

<!-- Task-specific examples -->
```{petk:include}
path: examples/classification/*.md
order_by: last_updated_desc
limit: 3
```

<!-- Context for current task -->
```{petk:include}
path: context/{{domain}}/current-context.md
```
`````

**Systematic Experimentation**
Support for deterministic prompt variant generation enables systematic A/B testing and optimization:

````markdown
<!-- Generate consistent test sets -->
```{petk:include}
path: test-cases/**/*.md
order_by: random
seed: 42
limit: 10
```
````

### Addressing Prompt Engineering Pain Points

**Context Window Optimization**
- Intelligent content selection based on relevance and token limits
- Automated content prioritization and truncation strategies
- Token counting and optimization tools

**Version Management**
- Git-friendly Markdown format for proper version control
- Clear separation between content and logic
- Trackable changes to prompt templates and components

**Team Collaboration**
- Human-readable format accessible to subject matter experts
- Clear documentation of prompt logic and decision points
- Reusable patterns that can be shared across projects

**Rapid Iteration**
- Quick template processing for fast feedback cycles
- Watch mode for real-time prompt development
- Integration with testing and evaluation pipelines

## Real-World Prompt Engineering Patterns

### 1. Few-Shot Learning Templates

**Challenge**: Providing effective examples for AI models to learn from without exceeding context limits.

**Petk Solution**:
````markdown
# {{task_name}} Instructions

{{base_instructions}}

## Examples

```{petk:include}
path: examples/{{task_type}}/**/*.md
order_by: "{{example_strategy}}"
limit: "{{max_examples}}"
```

## Your Task

\{\{current_task\}\}
````

**Benefits**:
- Dynamic example selection based on task type
- Configurable example strategies (recent, diverse, high-quality)
- Automatic limit enforcement to stay within token budgets

### 2. Chain of Thought Prompting

**Challenge**: Structuring complex reasoning tasks with consistent formatting and examples.

**Petk Solution**:
````markdown
```{petk:include}
path: reasoning/chain-of-thought-instructions.md
```

## Reasoning Examples

```{petk:include}
path: reasoning/examples/{{domain}}/*.md
```

## Problem to Solve

\{\{problem_statement\}\}

Think through this step by step:
1. **Understanding**: What is being asked?
2. **Analysis**: What information do I need?
3. **Reasoning**: How do I solve this?
4. **Conclusion**: What is my final answer?
````

**Benefits**:
- Consistent reasoning structure across different domains
- Domain-specific examples that can be maintained separately
- Clear template for complex multi-step reasoning

### 3. Context-Aware Prompt Assembly

**Challenge**: Including relevant context while managing token limits and maintaining relevance.

**Petk Solution**:
````markdown
```{petk:include}
path: context/beginner-background.md
if: user.experience_level === 'beginner'
```

```{petk:include}
path: examples/complex-scenarios/*.md
if: task.complexity === 'high'
limit: 2
```

```{petk:include}
path: knowledge-base/{{domain}}/**/*.md
order_by: last_updated_desc
limit: "{{context_limit}}"
```
````

**Benefits**:
- Adaptive context based on user characteristics
- Intelligent content selection based on task requirements
- Configurable limits for different deployment scenarios

### 4. Multi-Model Prompt Variants

**Challenge**: Adapting prompts for different AI models with varying capabilities and prompt formats.

**Petk Solution**:
````markdown
```{petk:include}
path: prompts/gpt4-optimized.md
if: model.type === 'gpt-4'
```

```{petk:include}
path: prompts/claude-optimized.md
if: model.type === 'claude'
```

```{petk:include}
path: prompts/generic-format.md
if: model.type !== 'gpt-4' && model.type !== 'claude'
```

## Task

\{\{task_description\}\}

```{petk:include}
path: examples/{{model.type}}-examples/*.md
limit: 3
```
````

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth with model-specific optimizations
- Consistent task definition across different model formats
- Easy maintenance of model-specific examples and formats

## Integration with AI Development Workflows

### Development Pipeline Integration

**Template Processing in CI/CD**:
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Generate Prompts
  run: |
    petk process prompts/ --output dist/prompts/
    petk convert dist/prompts/*.md prompt-configs/ --to yaml
```

**Dynamic Prompt Generation**:
```javascript
// Runtime prompt assembly
import { processTemplate } from '@petk/engine';

const prompt = await processTemplate('user-query-template.md', {
  user_context: userProfile,
  task_type: requestType,
  max_tokens: modelLimits.contextWindow * 0.8
});
```

### Testing and Evaluation Workflows

**Systematic Prompt Testing**:
````markdown
<!-- Test case generation -->
```{petk:include}
path: test-scenarios/**/*.md
order_by: random
seed: "{{test_seed}}"
limit: "{{test_batch_size}}"
```
````

**A/B Testing Support**:
````markdown
<!-- Version A -->
```{petk:include}
path: instructions/detailed-instructions.md
if: variant === 'detailed'
```

<!-- Version B -->
```{petk:include}
path: instructions/concise-instructions.md
if: variant === 'concise'
```
````
