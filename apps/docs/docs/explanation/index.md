# Explanation

This section helps you understand the concepts, design decisions, and architectural thinking behind Petk. Use this when you want to understand the "why" behind the toolkit's design and implementation.

## Core Concepts

### Template Philosophy
- **Dynamic Content Generation** - Why Petk focuses on dynamic template processing
- **Functional Programming Approach** - The reasoning behind functional design patterns
- **Configuration-Driven Development** - How configuration shapes template behavior
- **Modular Architecture** - Why Petk is built as a modular monorepo

### Design Principles
- **Simplicity Over Complexity** - Keeping templates readable and maintainable
- **Convention Over Configuration** - Sensible defaults with customization options
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between engine, converter, and CLI
- **Developer Experience First** - Prioritizing ease of use and debugging

### Template Engine Concepts
- **Include Resolution** - How dynamic content inclusion works internally
- **Variable Scoping** - Variable resolution and inheritance patterns
- **Processing Pipeline** - The multi-stage template processing workflow
- **Error Handling Strategy** - Graceful error recovery and debugging support

## Architectural Decisions

### Monorepo Structure
- **Why Turborepo?** - Benefits of the chosen build system and tooling
- **Package Organization** - Logic behind the current package structure
- **Dependency Management** - Strategy for managing shared dependencies
- **Development Workflow** - How the monorepo supports development velocity

### Technology Choices
- **TypeScript First** - Why TypeScript is the primary language
- **Node.js Runtime** - Platform considerations and compatibility
- **YAML Configuration** - Benefits of YAML over other configuration formats
- **Markdown Processing** - Design decisions in the converter architecture

### API Design
- **CLI Interface** - Command structure and usability considerations
- **Template Syntax** - Language design choices and trade-offs
- **Configuration Schema** - Validation and extensibility approaches
- **Error Messages** - User-friendly error reporting strategy

## System Architecture

### Processing Flow
```
Input Templates → Parser → Engine → Processor → Output Files
                    ↓         ↓         ↓
                Config → Variables → Includes → Validation
```

### Component Relationships
- **Engine Core** - Central template processing logic
- **CLI Interface** - User interaction and command orchestration
- **Converter Module** - Specialized Markdown-to-YAML processing
- **Utility Functions** - Shared functionality across packages

### Data Flow
- **Configuration Loading** - How settings cascade and override
- **Template Discovery** - File system traversal and pattern matching
- **Content Processing** - Multi-pass processing for complex templates
- **Output Generation** - File writing and directory structure management

## Design Trade-offs

### Performance vs. Flexibility
- **Template Complexity** - Balancing power with processing speed
- **Memory Usage** - Handling large templates and batch processing
- **Caching Strategy** - When to cache vs. reprocess content
- **Parallelization** - Concurrent processing considerations

### Developer Experience vs. Simplicity
- **Configuration Options** - Providing flexibility without overwhelming users
- **Error Messages** - Detailed diagnostics vs. concise feedback
- **Template Syntax** - Expressive power vs. learning curve
- **CLI Commands** - Feature completeness vs. interface simplicity

### Maintenance vs. Features
- **Code Organization** - Modular design for long-term maintainability
- **Testing Strategy** - Comprehensive testing without slowing development
- **Documentation** - Keeping docs current with rapid development
- **Backward Compatibility** - Evolution strategy for breaking changes

## Future Considerations

### Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture** - Plans for extending functionality
- **Custom Processors** - User-defined template processing logic
- **Template Libraries** - Sharing and distributing template collections
- **Integration Ecosystem** - Building connections with other tools

### Scalability
- **Large Projects** - Handling enterprise-scale template systems
- **Performance Optimization** - Future improvements for speed and memory
- **Distributed Processing** - Multi-machine template processing
- **Cloud Integration** - Native cloud platform support

### Evolution Strategy
- **API Stability** - Maintaining compatibility while adding features
- **Migration Paths** - Smooth upgrades for existing projects
- **Community Input** - Incorporating user feedback into design decisions
- **Technology Updates** - Keeping current with ecosystem changes

## Comparison with Alternatives

### Template Engines
- **Why Not Handlebars?** - Limitations that led to custom engine development
- **Differences from Jinja2** - Unique features and design philosophy
- **Static Site Generators** - How Petk complements vs. replaces SSGs
- **Enterprise Solutions** - Positioning against commercial template tools

### Build Systems
- **Integration vs. Replacement** - Working with existing build pipelines
- **Monorepo Tools** - Why Turborepo over Lerna or Nx
- **CI/CD Considerations** - Template processing in automated workflows
- **Development Servers** - Hot reloading and development experience
